# Data_Visualization
The Data Visualization Project from Python Crash Course 2nd Ed. by Eric Matthes.

Short description of the project:
In the data visualization project you'll learn to generate data and create a
series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib
and Plotly. It teaches you to access data from online sources and feed it into
a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a map of global
earthquake activity. Finally, it shows you how to write a program to
automatically download and visualize data. Learning to make visualizations
allows you to explore the field of data mining, which is a highly sought-after
skill in the world today.
